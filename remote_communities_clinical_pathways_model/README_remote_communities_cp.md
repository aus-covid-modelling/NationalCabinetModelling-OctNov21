\
# Running\
\
The clinical outcomes code was written in MATLAB 2019b.\
\
The code relies on output from the remote communities agent based transmission model in the form of a csv containing simulated number of cases by date of symptoms, age bracket (in 5 year intervals up to 80+), vaccine product, vaccine dose, symptom status and doses at infection. Reactive vaccines are classified as a different product (to account for different efficacy in the recently vaccinated).}
